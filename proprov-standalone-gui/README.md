# ProProv

ProProv is a graphical user interface (GUI) prototype to assist non-expert policy writers in constructing application-specific provenance policies. It contains selection mechanisms for selecting language constructs from a domain-specifc policy specification language for provenance policies. ProProv is written in Java, using the JavaFX platform for GUI components.

## Installation

ProProv requires Java 8, which contains JavaFX. The easiest way to run ProProv is to open the source files in an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

## Usage

To construct policies in ProProv, start by selecting a policy from the drop-down menu on the GUI. Based on the policy selection, more drop-down menu's may appear to complete the specification of the policy. Continue the aforementioned process until the policy is complete.

## Additional notes

### Future modifications

This code will be used to run usabiliity experiments at the University of South Florida. Additional code may be implemented to collect user data during the experiments, such as time and (in)correct specification.

### Source files

During the experiments, participants will be asked to perform 7 tasks using ProProv. Each top-level folder contains the source files for a specific task. These tasks have been separated to more easily integrate with the code-base developed by the University of South Florida. Therefore, many of the source files in each folder are duplicates.
