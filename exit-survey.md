# Exit Questions

The exit survey contained 10 SUS-style questions, which are presented separately from the rest of the survey, for ease of reading. 

## SUS-Style Questions

Each question asked the participant to select one of the following: `Strongly Disagree`, `Disagree`, `Neither Agree or Disagree`, `Agree`, or `Strongly Agree`.  These questions were used to compute a SUS score
